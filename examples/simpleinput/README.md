## Axes

This program demonstrates how to use the simplified
input components of the evdev library. These will attempt
to automatically bind to a set of specified devices and
give you immediate access to their events.

E.g.: We want a list of all keyboards, or all mouse-like
devices.


### Usage

	$ go build
	$ ./simpleinput
